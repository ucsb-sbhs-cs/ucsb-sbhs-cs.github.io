topic: "Privacy Concerns"
desc: "Your privacy, as a student enrolled in this course"
---

Throughout this course, most assignments will involve creating some content or application that is available to public on the web.

It is important for you to know how to protect your personal privacy as you create content in this course.

1. You are not required to reveal your name, or any identifying information about yourself, 
   in any of the content you create that would be available to the public on the web.
   
   You may be accustomed to putting your name in a comment at the top of your code.  <b>Don't do that in this class</b>,
   unless you and your parents/guardians are comfortable with your name appearing in public connected to your work.
   
2.  If you want to remain anonymous regarding the content you put online for this course, then 
    when you sign up for a github account, if you want to remain anonyous, choose an account name that does not reveal
    your identity (for example, webcoder123 or programmer14), and use your 9999999@my.sbunified.org email address.    
    
    Think carefully about what your name reveals.  A name such
    as sbhsdons2017 conceals your personal identity, but does reveal that you likely have some connection 
    with Santa Barbara High School.   If you are comfortable with that, fine, but think about it before you choose.
    
3.  On the other hand, if you already have a github account associated with your own name, and/or an email that reveals
    your identity, and if you and your parents/guardians are comfortable with that, then it is perfectly fine to go ahead
    and use the github account that you already have.
