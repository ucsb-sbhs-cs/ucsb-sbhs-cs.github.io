In this course, we will use JavaScript for client side web programming only.

For client side web programming, JavaScript (or languages that "compile to JavaScript) such as CoffeeScript) 
are pretty much the only choice available.  This is because client side processing happens inside your web browser, 
and most browsers support only JavaScript.

JavaScript is also sometimes used for server side processing&mdash;for example, the node.js framework is a server-side framework based
on JavaScript.   We will use Python and the Flask framework instead, 
so we will not discuss JavaScript as a server side language.   (For more information about why we are using Flask, see the [topic article on Flask](/topics/flask/).)
