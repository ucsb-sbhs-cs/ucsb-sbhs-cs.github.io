In Designing Software for the Web, we are using Flask as our main server-side web development platform

# Why Flask?

There are many possible choices of web development platform, including but not limited to:

* Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
* Django (Python)
* node.js (JavaScript)
* Play (Java)

We chose Flask because:
* Python is an easy language to learn, and increasingly important in both college/university coursework, as well as industry applications
* Flask is an easy framework to learn
* Once you have learned one web framework, it is reasonably straightforward to learn another
