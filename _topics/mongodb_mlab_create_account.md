You are probably very used to the process of signing up for an account for some online service, social media site, app, etc.

Signing up for MLab is a little tricky, so please read this first.

![signup form](mlab_signup.png)

In the Account name field, put something that will identify YOU as an individual.  For example, it could be your full name, such as `chrislopez99` or `patsmith3` or if you prefer not to use anything that identifies you, you could use something like `pythonlearner07`, `moviefan23`, etc.

The point is that the Account name field is what you will use to login to mlab.com.  

The username field is NOT what you think it is--you will not use that to login to mlab.com.  Instead, that is what your webapp will use to login to mlab to access data.  We typically use something such as `dbuser1` here.
