You are probably very used to the process of signing up for an account for some online service, social media site, app, etc.

Signing up for MLab is a little tricky, so please read this first.

![signup form](mlab_signup.png)

Choose a username such as `chrislopez99` or `patsmith3`&mdash;or if you prefer not to use anything that identifies you, you could use something like `pythonlearner07` or `moviefan23`&mdash;and then <b>enter it in BOTH the account AND the username fields</b>.
