Github offers a simple way to publish websites called "github pages".  

There are some limitations of github pages, but for simple pages involving only basic HTML, or HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it is an easy way to get started and get your content on the web.

Here are the basic instructions for getting a simple web page online with github pages.   After this overview, there is more detail about each step.

1.  Create a (free) github.com account.
2.  Create a repository.  
   * You only need to give it a name, and click the button for "Initialize this repository with a README".   
   * For everything else, the defaults are fine (public, "Add .gitignore: None", and "Add a license: None").
   * Choose the name carefully, since the url for your website will be of the form `username.github.io/repo-name`. 
3.  Create a branch called `gh-pages`.
4.  Change the default branch to `gh-pages`
5.  Create or upload your content:
   * Create an index.html file to be the home page for the site.
   * HTML, CSS and JavaScript files are supported.  
   * Server side code (e.g. PHP, Python, Perl, Ruby) is not.
6.  View your webpage at username.github.io/repo-name

# Create a free github.com account

Visit <http://github.com> and create an account on the free plan.

Choose your username wisely, since it will be part of your professional identity as a coder.  Potential employers often look at your github.com repos to see examples of your coding work.  You may find it better to choose something like `jklopez4` rather than `coolskaaterkid23` or `iceskreemfan`.  

# Create a repository

To create a repository, you need to be logged in to your account at the
page <http://github.com>.  Go to the upper right hand corner of the page,
and click the + sign, to bring down the "create" menu, as shown below.  Select "New&nbsp;repository".

Once you select New repository, you should see a screen like this one:

Fill in the name:

Click the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README":

![init with README](init_with_README.png)

And then click the Create repository button:

![click create repo](click_create_repo.png)
