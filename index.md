<h2>Curriculum Design Constraints</h2>
* The SBHS school year is divided into four 9-week quarters.    
* A curriulum with 12 units should proceed on an average pace of one unit every three weeks.   
* Each week provides an opportunity for about 2.5 hours of instruction and 2.5 hours of lab.
* Thus: 7.5 hours of instruction and 7.5 hours of student lab time for each unit.
* Note that students should be able to complete all lab work in class (unlike the expectations for a University course, for example.)

# Some ideas 

* Sky sometimes uses a "Do Now" exercise during the first few minutes of class.
    * This can be helpful... make these if they are educationally valuable.
    * Typically "review": 
       * We did it yesterday and it was new, let's get it back in your mind.
       * We did it a long time ago, but we need it today, so let's remind you.
       * This is a type of exam question you might get--let's practice.
    * Ok to skip it if its just busy work.
* Lecture in small chunks, divided up by "now apply this".
    * Live coding, alternating with students try it.
* Sometimes its just "work on this project" and teacher walks around and just helps students with 
* Exams take the form, typically of quizzes and unit tests (exam at end of each unit).

DSW:

* Mon, Tue: 57 minutes
* Wed OR Thu: 92 minutes
* Fri: 57 minutes
