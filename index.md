<h2>Curriculum Design Constraints</h2>
* The SBHS school year is divided into four 9-week quarters.    
* A curriulum with 12 units should proceed on an average pace of one unit every three weeks.   
* Each week provides an opportunity for about 2.5 hours of instruction and 2.5 hours of lab.
* Thus: 7.5 hours of instruction and 7.5 hours of student lab time for each unit.
* Note that students should be able to complete all lab work in class (unlike the expectations for a University course, for example.)
