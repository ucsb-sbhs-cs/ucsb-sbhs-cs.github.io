<h2>Information needed for UC A-G requirements</h2>

For EACH unit of the course, please provide:

1. A unit title
2. A concise 3-5 sentences describing the topics being addressed that demonstrate the critical thinking, depth, and progression of the content covered
3. A brief 3-5 sentences summarizing a key assignment from this unit and covering:
    * how a student will complete this assignment
    * what a student will produce
    * what the student will learn

Most importantly, use the unit(s) and key assignment(s) to demonstrate that the course meets the [subject-specific course criteria on the A-G Guide](http://www.ucop.edu/agguide/a-g-requirements/index.html)

For [area g](http://www.ucop.edu/agguide/a-g-requirements/g-college-prep/index.html), those are:

<b>Goals of the requirement<b>:  The intent of the college-preparatory elective requirement is to encourage prospective UC students to fill out their high school programs with courses taken in grades 9-12 that will meet one or more of the following objectives:

* Strengthen general study skills, particularly analytical reading, expository writing, and oral communications;
* Provide an opportunity to begin work that could lead directly into a major program of study at the University; and
* Experience, at some depth, new areas of academic disciplines that might form the basis for future major or minor studies at the University.

All elective courses must satisfy the following general criteria to meet the area “g” requirement:

* Be academically challenging;
* Involve substantial reading and writing;
* Include problem-solving and laboratory work, as appropriate;
* Show serious attention to analytical thinking, as well as factual content;
* Develop students’ oral and listening skills; and
* Incorporate learning to develop skills and cultivate interest in the academic enterprise.

Courses specifically approved in the “g” subject area include those such as political science, economics, geography, humanities, psychology, sociology, anthropology, journalism, speech or debate, computer science, computer programming and others. In addition, courses that are interdisciplinary in nature, drawing knowledge from two or more fields, are also acceptable.

Approved “g” courses that cannot be categorized in any of the “a-f” areas must provide academically challenging study at the same level of rigor as courses in the “a-f” subject matter fields. These elective courses must have appropriate prerequisites and present material at a sufficient depth to allow students to achieve mastery of fundamental knowledge that prepares them for University work or a future career path.
