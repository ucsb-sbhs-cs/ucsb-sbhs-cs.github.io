Designing Software for the Web is intended as a second or third year course in Computer Science, in which students will learn programming, design patterns, data management, scalable cloud computing, and principles of collaborative software development for full stack web application development, including both front-end (browser side) and back-end (server side) code.

Students will demonstrate mastery of these skills by constructing web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, and Python for the back end.

The goals of of this course are:

* to develop students' critical thinking skills via the application of computational thinking practices in solving problems and developing algorithms, in an academically challenging way,
* to develop students' written and oral communication skills via team-oriented software engineering practices.
* to develop students' ability to take responsibility for their own learning, by scaffolding them towards independence in learning new skills and technologies
* to develop students' interest in further study of Computer Science by offering engaging problem solving experiences in a relevant, modern context, i.e. web applications.
