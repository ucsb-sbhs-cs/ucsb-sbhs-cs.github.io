uc_ag_summary: >
  In this unit added only to the honors section of the course, the student will learn about two practices that are a part of Agile software development: writing user stories, and managing those user stories through the software development process via a kanban board.
  The student will also learn about features of git/github that are designed to support software development teams, such as issues, branches, forks, and pull requests.

uc_ag_assignment: >
  A key assignment for this unit will be to develop user stories for an application that the student (or the student's team, if working in a team) is developing, to enter those stories into github as issues, setup a work flow for the team using branches or forks, and then move one or more stories through the kanban board to completion.
  Students will learn how to use the Agile software design methodology to manage a software project.
