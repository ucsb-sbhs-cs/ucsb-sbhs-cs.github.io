uc_ag_summary: >
  In this unit, the student learn to identify key components, skills, technologies and terminology that are needed for the rest of the course.
  These include:  the distinction betwen static and dynamic web content, client vs server side technologies, the request/response model of web interaction, and the role each of the following plays in the display of a web page:  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  A small amount of Python code will be covered, but most Python details are deferred to later units.
  The student will also learn a few hands-on skills for producing  both static and dynamic web pages and will produce a few small examples that will serve as starting points for later projects that explore these topics in more depth.   
  Additional topics include learning the components of URLs, the distinction between GET and POST requests, how to handle form data, URL components, localhost and the role of ports, a few basics of using git/github for version control, and deploying content the the web via github pages and via Heroku.

uc_ag_assignment: >
  A key assignment from this unit is the completion of a project that deploys a single static web page that includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript code via github pages, and two dynamic web pages using Python Flask on Heroku.    
  The student will be guided through several examples, and then asked to complete an example on their own with different content.   
  Through the completion of this assignment the student will learn to develop useful skills and cultivate interest in Computer Science.
