uc_ag_summary: >
  In this unit, the student learn to identify key components, skills, technologies and terminology that are needed for the rest of the course.
  These include:  the distinction betwen static and dynamic web content, client vs server side technologies, the request/response model of web interaction, and the role each of the following plays in the display of a web page:  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  A small amount of Python code will be covered, but most Python details are deferred to later units.
  The student will also learn a few hands-on skills for producing  both static and dynamic web pages and will produce a few small examples that will serve as starting points for later projects that explore these topics in more depth.   
  Additional topics include learning the components of URLs, the distinction between GET and POST requests, how to handle form data, URL components, localhost and the role of ports, a few basics of using git/github for version control, and deploying content the the web via github pages and via Heroku.

uc_ag_assignment: >
  A key assignment from this unit is the completion of a project that deploys a single static web page that includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript code via github pages, and two dynamic web pages using Python Flask on Heroku.    
  The student will be guided through several examples, and then asked to complete an example on their own with different content.   
  Through the completion of this assignment the student will learn to develop useful skills and cultivate interest in Computer Science.

A concise 3-5 sentences describing the topics being addressed that demonstrate the critical thinking, depth, and progression of the content covered

A brief 3-5 sentences summarizing a key assignment from this unit and covering:
* how a student will complete this assignment
* what a student will produce
* what the student will learn


Most importantly, use the unit(s) and key assignment(s) to demonstrate that the course meets the subject-specific course criteria for a [g course on the A-G guide](http://www.ucop.edu/agguide/a-g-requirements/g-college-prep/index.html)

* Strengthen general study skills, particularly analytical reading, expository writing, and oral communications;
* Provide an opportunity to begin work that could lead directly into a major program of study at the University; and
* Experience, at some depth, new areas of academic disciplines that might form the basis for future major or minor studies at the University.

Course criteria & guidance

All elective courses must satisfy the following general criteria to meet the area “g” requirement:

* Be academically challenging;
* Involve substantial reading and writing;
* Include problem-solving and laboratory work, as appropriate;
* Show serious attention to analytical thinking, as well as factual content;
* Develop students’ oral and listening skills; and
* Incorporate learning to develop skills and cultivate interest in the academic enterprise.
