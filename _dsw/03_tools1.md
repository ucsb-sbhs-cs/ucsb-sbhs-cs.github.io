learning_objectives:
 - "The student will be able to create test cases for simple numeric functions"
 - "The student will be able to create test cases for functions involving complex data types"
 - "The student will be able to identify which parts of a Python unittest suite are annotations (e.g.  @unittest.skip())"
 - "The student will be able to differentiate between inherited methods and user-defined methods in the limited context of extending the unittest class to create test suites"
 - "The student will demonstrate an ability to use the Python documentation to locate the inherited methods of unittest"
 - "The student will be able to explain the red/green/refactor cycle"
 - "The student will be able to demonstrate the red/green/refactor cycle"

 - "The student will be able to write the appropriate unittest methods to check that the correct Python exceptions are thrown"
 - "The student will demonstrate an understanding of importing modules, both user-defined and standard modules"
 - "The student will demonstrate an understanding of how to create their own modules"
 - "The student will demonstrate that they can use pip to install third-party libraries and then import them in their code"
