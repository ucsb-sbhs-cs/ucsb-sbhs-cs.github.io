 - "JSON modules in Python (json.loads() and json.dumps())"
 - "Accessing JSON APIs"
 - "Access tokens and rate limits"
 - "Review of environment variables for storing access tokens"

 - "The student will be able to write simple encodings of data using JSON syntax"
 - "The student will be able to locate and correct simple syntax errors in JSON syntax"
 - "The student will be able to write code demonstrating the proper use of the Python json.loads() and json.dumps() methods"
 - "The student will be able to correctly identify what the letters API stand for, and explain the concept"
 - "The student will be able to explain the concept of a rate limited API"
 - "The student will be able to write code that accesses read-only APIs via HTTP, using access tokens and respecting rate limits"
 - "The student will be able to correctly write Python code that computes functions over the data returned by a JSON API, given that the data structure may contain nested lists and dictionaries."
 - "The student will be able to write Python code that presents the results of JSON queries in a way that is readable by a human end user, using HTML tables or lists, as appropriate."
